    <h2>This is my second to last semester!</h2>
    
</body>
<p> I'm from Flagstaff, Arizona but I am currently living in Ivins, Utah which is just outside of St. George. It's nice bceause I get to live in a small town, but being only 15 minutes away from St. George, I am so close to a larger city. </p>
    <p>I love off-roading, working on cars, speaking spanish and learning languages (I'm currently learning Portugese), flying my drone, and playing board games.</p>
    <p>I got married in June of 2019, but we don't have any kids yet though it is something both my wife and I are looking forward to. </p> 
    <p>I work remotely for a marketing agency called Vulpine Marketing and absolutley LOVE it there, it's such a great company with a fantstic culture.</p>
    <p>I am in my second to last semester of my Business Management with an emphasis in Markering bachelor's degree. I've always wanted to learn how to code HTML and there is even a web design department where I work, so I thought it would be a great skill to have. </p>
    <p>As far as church membership, I was born into the church, but I definitly went through my own conversion that keeps me active and believing today. I know it's the true church! </p>
